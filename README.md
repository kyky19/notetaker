  ## Description
  This is an app that uses express.js to send and retrieve data from a JSON file. It allows users to save and delete notes.
  
  ## Usage
  To use the project, users must visit the deployed link and enter in a note with a description. It is then saved to the JSON file and to the left of the page. More notes can be added, and there is a trash can near every note to allow users to delete the note.
  ## Installation
  Installing the project can be done by cloning the code via my github link. Users can also simply visit the deployed Heroku website.
